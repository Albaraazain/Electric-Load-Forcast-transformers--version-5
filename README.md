# Energy Load Forecasting Implementation Using Informer Architecture

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of energy load forecasting using the Informer architecture. The implementation is specifically designed for predicting energy consumption patterns with a focus on handling the unique challenges of energy load data, such as multiple seasonal patterns, irregular peaks, and complex external dependencies.

## Technical Overview

### Architecture Design Considerations

The Informer architecture is adapted for energy load forecasting through several key modifications:

1. **Input Processing**: The system handles energy consumption data in kilowatt-hours (kWh) with configurable aggregation periods (default: hourly). Raw data can be at higher frequencies (e.g., 15-minute intervals) and is automatically aggregated using the provided utilities.

2. **Temporal Feature Engineering**: The implementation includes specialized temporal feature extraction that captures multiple seasonality patterns common in energy consumption:
   - Hour-of-day (24-hour cycle)
   - Day-of-week (7-day cycle)
   - Month-of-year (annual cycle)
   - Holiday indicators
   - Weekend/weekday patterns

3. **Attention Mechanism**: The ProbSparse attention mechanism is optimized for energy load patterns by:
   - Prioritizing recent temporal dependencies
   - Maintaining long-term seasonal relationships
   - Efficient handling of periodic patterns

4. **Memory Optimization**: Implementation includes specific optimizations for handling long sequences of energy data:
   - Gradient checkpointing for reduced memory usage
   - Efficient batch processing with dynamic batch sizes
   - Mixed-precision training implementation

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline (`src/data/preprocessing.py`) implements several energy-specific features:

```python
# Example of the preprocessing workflow:

1. Data Loading and Validation:
   - Checks for missing timestamps
   - Validates energy consumption values (non-negative)
   - Handles timezone conversions

2. Feature Generation:
   - Cyclic encoding of temporal features
   - Holiday effect encoding
   - Rolling statistics calculation

3. Data Normalization:
   - Adaptive scaling based on historical patterns
   - Separate scaling for peak and off-peak periods
```

### Model Architecture Details

The Informer model (`src/model/informer.py`) includes energy-specific modifications:

1. **Encoder Structure**:
   - Input dimension: 8 (energy + 7 temporal features)
   - Default sequence length: 48 hours (configurable)
   - Attention heads: 8 (optimized for daily patterns)

2. **Decoder Structure**:
   - Output dimension: 1 (energy consumption)
   - Prediction horizon: 24 hours (configurable)
   - Progressive decoder for improved long-term forecasting

3. **Layer Configuration**:
   ```python
   class InformerConfig:
       # Architecture parameters
       d_model: int = 256        # Model dimension
       n_heads: int = 8          # Attention heads
       e_layers: int = 3         # Encoder layers
       d_layers: int = 2         # Decoder layers
       d_ff: int = 512          # Feed-forward dimension
       
       # Energy-specific parameters
       input_features: int = 8   # Energy + temporal features
       input_window: int = 192   # 8 days of hourly data
       prediction_window: int = 24  # 24-hour prediction
   ```

### Training Implementation

The training pipeline (`src/training/trainer.py`) includes several energy forecasting-specific features:

1. **Loss Function**: Implements a composite loss that balances:
   - Overall prediction accuracy (MSE)
   - Peak load prediction accuracy (weighted MSE for peak periods)
   - Pattern consistency (temporal coherence loss)

2. **Learning Rate Schedule**:
   ```python
   # Specialized scheduler implementation
   class WarmupCosineScheduler:
       """
       Implements warmup + cosine decay schedule optimized for energy data:
       - Initial warmup period: 3 epochs
       - Cosine decay: Matches weekly patterns
       - Minimum LR: Maintains model adaptability
       """
   ```

3. **Validation Strategy**:
   - Multi-horizon validation (1h, 6h, 24h predictions)
   - Separate metrics for peak and off-peak periods
   - Holiday-aware validation splits

### Performance Optimization

The implementation includes several optimizations for production deployment:

1. **Memory Management**:
   ```python
   # Example from training loop
   @torch.cuda.amp.autocast()
   def train_step(self, batch):
       """
       Optimized training step with:
       - Mixed precision training
       - Gradient accumulation
       - Memory-efficient attention
       """
   ```

2. **Inference Optimization**:
   - Batch inference support
   - CPU/GPU inference options
   - ONNX export capability

    - MAPE: Standard accuracy metric
    - Peak Load MAPE: Accuracy during high demand
    - Load Factor Error: Capacity utilization accuracy
    - Ramp Rate Error: Load change prediction accuracy
    """
```
